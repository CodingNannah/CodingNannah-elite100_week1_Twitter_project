# Homework: Twitter mockup using HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap!

## Also used:
    Twitter Embed
    Official Twitter Icons
        Google Icons
        FontAwesome Icons
        Icon Finder - created the "verify" icon
    Eye Dropper: Official Twitter Blue Color (CSS recognizes it)

## Cheated on the right panel. You'll see how.

# Instructions for the Homework:

Your mission is to Mock the Twitter webpage using Bootstrap.

* The Left Menu should be identical except for some icons you might not find in the Bootstrap Icons so just use the closest ones you can find.
* The Top portion of the middle section should look the same (with any user icon you want to use).
* You can use any Text and Images for the Tweets section, but they should follow the same form as the ones on the website.
* The Right Panel should be laid out the same, but once again the actual content can be what ever you want.

NOTE: The styling here (See: twitters.png in "images" file) is for an example of how you can easily size, and colorize the icon will need to be changed
